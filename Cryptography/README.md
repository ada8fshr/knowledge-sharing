# Cryptography 🔐 
Welcome to the Cryptography repository!🔒 If you're here, it means you're interested in learning about secret codes and how they keep our messages safe.

I've always been curious about cryptography, even though it's not a subject in my computer science classes. It's more like a math thing, but it's super cool because it's all about turning information into secret messages that only certain people can understand.

In this repository, I'll share what I've learned about cryptography in simple words. We'll explore how secret codes work, why they're important, and how they're used to keep our digital stuff safe.

So, if you're curious like me, let's dive into the world of cryptography together!🚀
