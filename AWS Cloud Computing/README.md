#### What is Cloud Computing? ü§ì
Cloud computing is like renting a computer, storage, or software over the internet instead of owning and maintaining your own physical hardware. Instead of running programs or storing data on your local computer, you can do it online through servers hosted by a third party.

#### Why Do We Need Cloud Computing? üëÄ
1. **Cost-Efficiency:** With cloud computing, you pay for what you use, avoiding the need to invest in expensive hardware upfront.
2. **Scalability:** It allows you to easily scale up or down based on your needs without the hassle of buying and installing new equipment.
3. **Accessibility:** You can access your data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, making collaboration and remote work more efficient.
4. **Massive Economies of scale:** Because of aggregate usage from all customers, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale and pass savings on to customers.

#### Types of Cloud Computing ‚ú®:
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can rent virtual machines and storage.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for users to install, maintain, and run the software.

#### Types of Deployment Models ü™Ñ:
1. **Public Cloud** ‚òÅÔ∏è:
  - **Explanation:** Imagine renting a virtual space on the internet. Many people, like you and others, share this space for various needs.
  - **Real-world Example:** Using Gmail or Google Drive, where you access and store your emails and documents on Google's servers that are shared with millions of users.

2. **Private Cloud** üè†: 
  - **Explanation:** This is like having your own exclusive club. Everything is just for your use. It's more private and customizable.
  - **Real-world Example:** A company might have its own servers that only its employees can use for storing and accessing files.
   
3. **Hybrid Cloud** üîÑ:
  - **Explanation:** Think of it as having a mix of both public and private spaces. Some things are shared with everyone, and some are just for your exclusive use.
  - **Real-world Example:** A business might use a public cloud for customer-facing apps and a private cloud for confidential business files.

4. **Community Cloud** üèòÔ∏è:
  - **Explanation:** It's like a shared neighborhood where certain houses (organizations) share common spaces. These houses have similar needs and work together.
  - **Real-world Example:** Different healthcare providers sharing a cloud platform for patient data exchange while ensuring privacy and compliance.

#### Major Cloud Providers üíé:
1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Offers a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, and databases.
2. **Microsoft Azure:** Provides a variety of services, from computing to analytics and storage, integrated with Microsoft products.
3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Offers cloud computing, storage, and machine learning services, backed by Google's infrastructure.

> In summary, cloud computing is a flexible, cost-effective solution that allows individuals and businesses to access and use computing resources over the internet. It offers various services and deployment models to suit different needs, and major providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP make these resources easily accessible to a global audience.

## AWS IAM üîê
Think of IAM as the security gatekeeper for your AWS account. It controls `who (users, groups, applications)` can do `what (actions)` and to `what (resources)`.

### Shared Responsibility Model üìú:
Imagine a pie cut in half.
- **AWS's half:** They manage the underlying infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities) and its security.
- **Your half:** You're responsible for securing your resources (data, applications, configurations) within the AWS account.

### Key Points üîë:

1. **Shared responsibility:**
   - AWS takes care of the "cloud infrastructure," you manage your "stuff within the cloud."
2. **IAM helps you assign access securely:**
   - Create users, groups, and roles.
   - Define what each can do (permissions) and which resources they can access.
3. **Securing your account:**
   - Use strong passwords, rotate them regularly.
   - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security.
   - Monitor your account activity and investigate suspicious behavior.
  
> You and AWS are partners in securing your cloud environment. By understanding and managing your share of the responsibility, you can keep your data and applications safe.

## AWS Storage üóÑ
Amazon offers several storage services that businesses and individuals can use to store their data securely and access it whenever they need to. Here are the main ones:

![AWS Storage](https://www.awsgeek.com/AWS-Storage-Gateway/AWS-Storage-Gateway.jpg)

### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) ü¶ã:
  - Think of it as a big digital warehouse where you can store any type of data, like documents, images, or videos.
  - For example, if you have a website, you can store all your images and files on S3, so they're safe and easy to access.

### Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) ü¶Ñ:
  - It's like having a hard drive in the cloud. You can store data that you need to access quickly, like operating systems or database files.
  - Imagine you're running a website with a database. You can use EBS to store the database files securely and ensure quick access whenever someone visits your site.

### Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) üêπ:
  - This is like having a shared network drive in the cloud. Multiple users or systems can access the same files simultaneously.
  - For example, if you're working on a project with your team, you can store all project files in EFS, and everyone can access and work on them together from different locations.

### Amazon S3 Glacier üêå:
  - It's a storage service for data that you don't need to access frequently but still want to keep for long-term storage.
  - Think of it as a vault for your digital files. For instance, you might use Glacier to store old backups or archives of your company's documents that you need to keep for legal reasons.

> Amazon storage services are like different types of storage units you can rent in the cloud. Depending on your needs, you can choose the one that best fits what you want to store and how you want to access it.
