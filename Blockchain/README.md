## Introduction to Blockchain 🗳️

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that's transforming various industries, from finance to healthcare and beyond. 
At its core, blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions across a network of computers. 
Each transaction is stored in a "block," which is linked to the previous block, forming a chronological chain of blocks - hence the name "blockchain."

> In simple words: It is a peer-to-peer system of transacting values with no trusted third parties in between.


## Centralized, Decentralized and Distributed Systems 📤
1. **Centralized System:**
   - In a centralized system, all the control and decision-making power rests with one central authority or organization. This authority holds the reins, making all the important choices and managing everything from top to bottom.
   - **Example:** Think of a company where there's a CEO who makes all the big decisions. The CEO has the final say on matters like hiring, firing, and how the company operates overall.

2. **Decentralized System:**
   - In a decentralized system, there's no single authority in charge. Instead, power and control are spread out among different entities or individuals. It's like a group effort where everyone has a say and can contribute equally.
   - **Example:** Imagine a group project where each team member has their own tasks and responsibilities. They work together, sharing ideas and making decisions collectively without one person being in charge of everything.

3. **Distributed System:**
   - Distributed systems take decentralization further by spreading out tasks and information across multiple locations or computers. This redundancy helps with reliability and resilience because if one part fails, the system can still keep running.
   - **Example:** Picture a network of interconnected computers sharing files. Instead of storing all the files in one central server, copies are distributed across several computers. If one computer goes down, the files are still accessible from others in the network.
